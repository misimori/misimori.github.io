I am *Postdoc Researcher* at University of Pittsburgh. My research interests lie at the intersection of physics-based modeling of cell mechanics, computational fluid dynamics and fluid structure interactions. My main projects are:
- Continuum modeling for rheology of cell cytoskeleton
- Integrating fluid flow, chemistry and mechanics to drive self-oscillations and spontaneous formation of 3D patterns in anchored microstructures
- Applications of reciprocal theorem for biphasic poro-viscoelastic materials
- Autonomous chemically-driven fluid pumping for particle transport, assembly and shape-morphing of elastic micro-structures
